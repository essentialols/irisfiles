      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

      <h2>How IrisFiles works</h2>

      <p>IrisFiles is a client-side file converter. All file processing happens entirely in your web browser using JavaScript, WebAssembly, and the Canvas API. Your files are never uploaded to any server. No file data leaves your device at any point during the conversion process.</p>

      <h2>Data we collect</h2>

      <p><strong>None.</strong> IrisFiles does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data or file data. There are no accounts, no cookies, no analytics, no tracking scripts, and no server-side logging of any kind.</p>

      <h2>Third-party resources</h2>

      <p>Some conversion tools lazy-load open-source libraries from <strong>cdn.jsdelivr.net</strong> (a public CDN). These requests are standard HTTP fetches for JavaScript and WebAssembly files. jsDelivr's own privacy policy applies to those network requests. No file data is sent to jsDelivr or any other third party.</p>

      <h2>Hosting</h2>

      <p>IrisFiles is hosted on Vercel as a static site. Vercel may log standard web server information (IP addresses, request timestamps, user agents) as part of normal CDN operation. IrisFiles has no access to or control over these logs. See <a href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel's privacy policy</a> for details.</p>

      <h2>Local storage</h2>

      <p>IrisFiles uses IndexedDB (browser-local storage) solely to pass files between pages when using the smart file dropper on the landing page. This data is temporary, stays on your device, and is deleted immediately after the target converter page reads it.</p>

      <h1>Disclaimer</h1>

      <h2>Use at your own risk</h2>

      <p>IrisFiles is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or contributors be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.</p>

      <h2>No guarantee of output quality</h2>

      <p>File conversions are performed using browser APIs and open-source libraries. Results may vary depending on your browser, operating system, and the specific files being converted. IrisFiles does not guarantee that converted files will be suitable for any particular purpose. Always keep your original files.</p>

      <h2>Large file warning</h2>

      <p>Converting large files (especially video, audio, and high-resolution images) happens entirely in your browser's memory. This means:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Large files may cause your browser tab to use significant memory (potentially several gigabytes for video conversions).</li>
        <li>Your browser may become slow or unresponsive during conversion of very large files.</li>
        <li>On devices with limited memory (phones, tablets, older computers), large conversions may fail or crash the browser tab.</li>
        <li>IrisFiles enforces a 100MB file size limit and a 100-megapixel image limit as safeguards, but even files within these limits can strain low-memory devices.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For best results with large files, close other browser tabs, use a desktop computer, and ensure you have sufficient free memory.</p>

      <h2>Not a professional tool</h2>

      <p>IrisFiles is a free, open-source utility. It is not a substitute for professional file conversion software. If you need guaranteed output quality, format compliance, or support for specialized workflows, use dedicated professional tools.</p>
